<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
    Passionate Computer Science student deeply immersed in the world of coding and technology. <br />
    I find joy in tackling coding challenges, diving into LeetCode problems, and continuously <br />
    expanding my knowledge of programming languages. My fascination with technology extends <br />
    to gaming, where I explore diverse gaming platforms and engage in game development as a <br />
    hobby. I thrive on the thrill of learning new tech trends and applying innovative solutions to <br />
    real-world problems.
</p>
<p>
    Aside from tech, I'm an avid music enthusiast, finding solace and inspiration in various genres. <br />
    I believe in balancing hard work with moments of enjoyment, often unwinding through clubbing <br />
    and having fun with friends. Beyond my personal interests, I actively trade stocks and forex, <br />
    showcasing my analytical skills and interest in financial markets.
</p>
<p>
    The love for learning extends to my personal life, cherishing my relationship with my fianc√©e <br />
    and valuing the importance of genuine connections with those around me. I deeply appreciate <br />
    teamwork and collaboration, traits honed through various experiences. My goal is to channel <br />
    my enthusiasm, technical acumen, and appreciation for diverse experiences into contributing <br />
    effectively to a dynamic tech team.
